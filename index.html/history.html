<p>I have been editing videos since 2018, I started off on a moblie editing app called InShot.</p>

<p>At this point I was making quick short simple videos, but I wanted to learn and get more complex with editing.</p>

<p>In late 2018/early 2019 I moved over to Capcut which at the time gave me more freedom to do more complex stuff for free.</p>

<p>Then in late 2019 I decided too move over to desktop, I used the family computer to edit but it couldn't handle heavy video editing.</p>
<p>When I moved over to desktop, I used a free editing software call DaVinci Resolve to edit videos.</p>

<p>Switching over to desktop was a whole new experience, the softwares between desktop and moblie were completely different.</p>

<p>moblie's editing softwares are more user friendly and I had to start from zero when learning how to use desktop</p>

<p>I studied it for days, watching youtube videos, experimenting, learning from other editors, etc.</p>

<p>In late 2020 I wanted to do heavier video editing so I bought a PC that is capable of editing and playing video games.</p>

<p>Around mid 2021 is when I started editing videos for other people and getting paid for it. </p>

<p>Through editing I made a bunch of new friends, connections, and it helped me learn a lot.</p>

<p>A buddy of mine shared his Adobe account with me, allowing me to use Premiere Pro</p>

<p>So I used DaVinci Resolve until mid 2023 then switching over to Premiere Pro.</p>

<p>Although the Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve were kind of similar it still took a while to get used to Premiere Pro</p>

<p> In February 2024, I wanted to make my own Content with a channel Im pretty serious about and I ended up actually making my channel.</p>

<p>Editing videos for other people and making my own content on my free time.</p>

<p>In September 2024, I built myself a whole new computer with better specs than my old computer but this time I focused more on the gaming aspects. </p>

<p>I ended up getting a Macbook for editng in November 2025 and thats what I usually use now to edit videos on.</p>

<p>Till this day I still use Premiere Pro but now I have my own account that I pay for myself.</p>

<p style="font-size: 35px;">Yup that's my history with editing videos!! :)</p>
